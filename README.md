> An Elegant todo **`Progressive Web Application`**
	
To do app to keep track of pending tasks and things, it will tell me and you what tasks we've got *to do!*

## PWA 
A [Progressive Web Application](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps)  (PWAs) are web apps that use [service workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API), [manifests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest), and other web-platform features in combination with [progressive enhancement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement) to give users an experience on par with native apps.


This project is made with [Create React App's PWA support](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/making-a-progressive-web-app/). To read more on it: [web.dev blogs](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/)

> Basically, you can add shortcut of the site to your mobile phone and use the app with or without internet! Cool, right? That's PWA!

### PWA Demo:
To install the PWA, simply use `Install app` or `Add to home screen` option from  the menu of your mobile phone browser. 

> You may be automatically prompted to install/add-shortcut of the web
> app depending on your browser(As you may see in the demo gif).

For desktop(Windows, Mac or Linux), click the `Install` icon on upper right corner in the URL bar to install the PWA as desktop app.
